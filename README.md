# Salvations Edge Verity (4th encounter) Solver/Practice

## About
This is an online tool that can be used to either solve or practice the Verity(4th) encounter from the Destiny 2 raid Salvations Edge. The reason for creating this was to help people get better at the encounter, or have a tool to just do it for them. No matter how people use this, I hope it is able to help and make things easier

## Future Features
- "How To?" page:
  - This will be an explanation on how to do the encounter
  - Might provide links to helpful videos on the how to solve.
- Practice tool:
  - This will let people practice as if they are in the encounter.
  - There will be a randomly generated starting input, and the user will be able to try and solve it.
  - There will be a way to look the solution in steps if anyone needs help
- Test tool:
  - This will be like the practice tool, but with no help. 
  - The user will be give 5 random states, and they have to solve them. 
  - Score will be based off of length of solve, not steps taken. There is always multiple ways to solve, so this is the best way I could come up with.
